          <h3>What are Databases?</h3>
          <h4>A structured set of data</h4>
          <span>Databases are a collection of information, they are used for creating, manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different types of databases and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational detabase or a non-relational database.</span>

          <h3 >Storage</h3>
          <img src="images/harddrive.jpg" alt="Stack of server hard drives">
          <span>All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed on your harddrive, often times large companies will have floors upon floors of just database storage (thing NSA styled). Our computer stores information on the harddrive. we are able to create new information, read information, update informatio, and delete information.</span>

          <h3>Searching</h3>
          <img src="images/database-search.jpg" alt="Man looking through folders">
          <span>Since there could potentially be a lot of information a database stores one problem we might run into is finding the data we are looking for.  Imagine we had a room full of books and you were asked to find the Coding Dojo Algorithm Book. Well you might start picking up each book, checking the title, and moving onto the next until you found it.  That's very slow, as most libraries dicovered.  Instead if we were to ID each item we can find it quickly.</span>

          <h3>Interaction</h3>
          <img src="images/dbinteraction.png" alt="Computers connected to a server">
          <span>The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a storage bin that holds onto all saved data.  Well if only one user had access to all that data it's just like what we have built into our own computers, it wouldn't be useful to other users.  However, the joy of having a database is that it is a storage bin many users can interact with, crating, reading, updating, and deleting information that all users would see.</span>

          <h3>Companies</h3>
          <img src="images/database-companies.jpg" alt="Collage of database company logos">
          <span>There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the storing of information.  As Big Data has erupted so too have the size and amount of companies on the market. That being said a lot of their software is free for most users.  Think of MySQL, which while being an incredible DB is completely free of cost and is used by a huge company called Facebook.</span>
